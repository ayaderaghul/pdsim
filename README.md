# check out this base repo

https://github.com/ayaderaghul/pdsim_base

so basically, i built upon this base repeated PD game, evolutionary style. the difference is i let agent to have an initial buffer to test opponent's cooperativeness. turns out it tests well, and is also forgiving.

idea: be vigilant in cooperation, but do hope for the day the good equilibrium come, you will find your partner!
